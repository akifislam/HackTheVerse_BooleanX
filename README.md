# Problem Identification and Risk Analysis

**Problem Statement** : Ample of Insecurity in Existing  Delivery Network
**Problem Definition and Risk Analysis** :
The growth of e-commerce in the last three years is 100 percent, and due to covid19, it has accelerated surprisingly. E-commerce platforms will introduce more than 3 lakh employment by next year, and the E-commerce platform Bangladesh requires a lot of human resources to run. Undoubtedly, it will be an excellent opportunity to eliminate unemployment and use human resources productively. But from the beginning of our business transition to e-commerce, we face several problems, such as lack of appropriate national policies, financial transaction security, interoperable infrastructure, inadequate human resources, slow, expensive internet, etc. With the fastest expansion and advancement of technology, we have made easy financial transaction support, reached a significant size of customers, created the platform economy, updated the interoperable system, and overcome almost all technical issues of platform operations. Now that our market size has enhanced, customer engagement has doubled. We require more human resources to grow and improve successfully.

In Bangladesh, e-commerce is newly introduced. People of Bangladesh are not used to this, customer trust with product and service has not reached up to the mark due to many known reasons, and so they have more faith in the Cash On Delivery system (90 percent). Thus, we are dependent on the delivery man to fetch and transmit the money from the customer to the concerned point for the financial transactions. But mostly, these e-commerce platforms are facing problems with the delivery man, stealing collected the cash of COD. Worldwide many e-commerce platforms are using efficient delivery channels, paying on cards, e-money, payment services, etc. We hope that soon, by the next 10 to 15 years, the e-money payment system will eliminate this COD system in Bangladesh too. But it is not the appropriate time to establish an e-money payment method entirely as it may create an uncomfortable zone for the customers, and we may lose many customers, which will make a good loss indeed.

The problem does not end with money thieves and transaction issues. We are facing the problem of stealing packages too. While delivering the product to the customer, the delivery men are fleeing away with expensive consequences. We have laws and policies to encounter these kinds of occurrences, but there is more dependency on enforcement. These crimes have become more difficult to suppress due to the lack of law enforcement, delays in law enforcement, and the rapid increase in the number of such incidents.

The people hired for delivery of the products are for a full-time job, and if they take leave without notice, it becomes challenging to hire a new delivery man instantly. On the other hand, if we manage a new delivery man somehow, we have to pay the current enrolled new and the old delivery man both at the same time.

Several statistics show, the people associated with delivering the products are adequate in number, and they are now proving to be not trustworthy. Most of the delivery men are not so educated and vulnerable in ethics and values. These reasons can fire any delivery man from this kind of employment opportunity, and the recruitment of these jobs is straightforward and so fast. Therefore, it is impossible and also a waste of platform resources to arrange training for every now and then recruited delivery man.

The above mentioned and descriptive problems are taking severe shapes day by day. For the continual growth of this e-commerce, it is so apparent we need adequate human resources but in a secure and trustworthy environment. But is it possible for Bangladesh to create human resources reliable overnight?


Should we take steps to create trustworthy human resources or to rebuild the whole existing delivery network system from the core?

# Idea Formulation
We are a 360-degree delivery network. We provide excellent delivery service solutions that help an e-Commerce platform or business to safely reach their customer. We are solving all the typical delivery problems from the root which will create a revolutionary change in e-commerce businesses. You can simply call us like an Uber for Delivery Network.

We are using an intelligent app called ‘**We Deliver Delivery Network**’. This app will not only solve delivery problems but also create employment opportunities for many unemployed young people in our country. The features of our app are described below

## Key Features of this Idea

### Stopped Stealing Packages
Our platform’s registration process is very secure and highly verified. So it is impossible for anyone to steal packages and flee away. Besides we will use geo-fencing technology to track our delivery man 24/7.

### Stopped Stealing Collected Cash of COD
We have redesigned the payment system in a new way where customers will directly pay to the company. So there will be no third party involvement.

### No Worries for  Unattended Delivery Man without Notice
We are using GPS and geo-fencing technology to track a delivery person all the time.

# App Features In Detail

### Be a Delivery Man Today
The unemployment problem is a terrible problem in Bangladesh. With our app, anyone with an internet-capable phone can register as a delivery person. Every morning our delivery men can identify possible delivery locations near him and they can select their suitable packages. One can join as a full time or part-time delivery man in our team. You can think of this idea like ‘Pathao’ or ‘Uber’ where people can join with their vehicles.  But as we ensure safe and secure delivery, the registration process for being a delivery man is a little bit complex. We appoint a delivery man through formal verification which we have discussed in the next point. We track our delivery men all the time through our app on our platform.

### Registration Process
When a person signs up in our application, he or she needs detailed information to register our app so that we can track them even after losing our connections.

Besides necessary information like full name, present address, permanent address, a formal photo etc, we will ask for a scan copy of their National Identification Card (NID) and biometric information. If one has no NID, then he or she must have to submit a scan copy of their birth registration certificate or passport. As biometric information, our app will ask for a fingerprint copy or a live captured photo with their selfie camera. Next we will take necessary information from their local guardian or relatives. In case we are unable to reach him, then we will contact them for further communications or any legal actions.

This information will help to track a delivery person if he or she steals any packages or items while delivery. Because of having these rules, a delivery man usually may not think of committing a suspicious activity. If he does, then we can take legal actions as we have all the necessary information to find them easily.


### Students can Join as a Freelancer Rider which was Impossible Before
In the common scenario, most of the delivery men live below the poverty line. As a result, most of them have the intention to earn more even if it is in an unethical way. So we always welcome students to our service. In our service,  a student over 18 years old can join us as a part time or a freelancer delivery man. In case of student registration, he may need to submit their academic ID card. Suppose a student wants to point ‘A’ to point ‘B. While going to point ‘B’, he will open our app and will check if there is any delivery to position B. If yes, then he will pick up the packages, reach the customers and get paid. They can deliver products on their academic holidays which will give an opportunity to earn extra money for a student. Also, students will be more polite and responsible than normal delivery men which will make a good impression on customers.

### Whole Delivery Process in Brief
Our delivery man will check our app in the morning for pending deliveries. Then he will choose a suitable location to deliver near him. Then he will collect packages from our branch offices or substations and then reach customers. While a delivery man will contain deliverables with him, he must have to keep his mobile data and GPS location turned on. This will help us to track them every time. After reaching customer ends, customers will scan QR code from his package. This will pop up a question like “In which method do you want to pay?” If a customer chooses ‘Cash on Delivery’, then the amount of money will be reduced from the delivery man’s digital protected wallet. Otherwise, if a customer chooses ‘Digital Transaction’, then customers will directly send money to the company.

In this process, delivery men will be excluded from the whole transaction and bill pay process. So this will ensure security of payment.

### Tracking Delivery Person  24 / 7
We will use the built in Global Positioning System of delivery man’s smartphone to track him. Besides, we will use geo-fencing technology. If the delivery man wants to flee away with deliverables, GPS tracker will send an alert if he skips a certain boundary of his location. Any unusual or suspicious activity will be reported to company owners. Suppose, if he is not moving for a long time, then the program will check on Google Maps  if he is in any traffic jam. If no, then it will be counted as a suspicious activity. Otherwise we can take legal actions as we have all the necessary information to find them easily.

### A new Perspective of Paying Cash on Delivery
We conduct our transaction digitally . In case of cash on delivery we will give a QR code our package and the customer will scan the product and payment will be in online currency.  Customers pay money directly to  the company account. Our delivery men have some deposited money on their account. In case the customers are willing to pay in cash then the deposited digital currency will be cut from our delivery man's account. The Delivery man will recharge their online currency account daily. After collecting cash he has to recharge the collected money from the nearest center as soon as possible because of security.
